Kirk the film has lost none of its hallucinatory power. The short goes deep into the structure of Peter Care’s original film and the Cabaret Voltaire tracks used in connection with it.

Richard H Kirk has reconfigured the film’s soundtrack giving the proceedings an ominous sense of something slowly sliding into view from afar glimpsed out of the corner of the eye.,1.243,,2008-01-01,0,0,19,Released,,4.0,4,Isaac Cohen-Andrea Lin-Salvatore Totino,short film
